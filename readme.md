# React Webpack Boilerplate+
A boilerplate I made using webpack with development and production in mind. It is also there to solidify my understanding of webpack configuration.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.
3. In your terminal type the following commands: **```npm i```**
4. then type **```npm run start```** to run the dev server
5. Develop??
6. when you're finished and want to build to production, type the command **```npm run build```**
7. Deploy!!
